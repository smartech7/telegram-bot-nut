This framework tries to make the **speed**, **scalability** and **flexibility** of use its strength, it will allow you to quickly
make simple bots, but at the same time, it provides more **advanced features** to handle even the most complicated flows.
Some of the architectural concepts on which Nutgram is based are heavily influenced by other open source projects such
as [Botman](https://github.com/botman/botman) and [Zanzara](https://github.com/badfarm/zanzara), check them out too!

```php
<?php

use SergiX44\Nutgram\Nutgram;

$bot = new Nutgram($_ENV['TOKEN']);

    $bot->sendMessage('Ciao!');
});

$bot->run();
```
