> The Telegram bot library that doesn't drive you nuts

This framework takes advantage of the latest **PHP 8** features, and tries to make the **speed**, **scalability** and **flexibility** of use its strength, it will allow you to quickly make simple bots, but at the same time, it provides
more **advanced features** to handle even the most complicated flows. Some architectural concepts on which
Nutgram is based are heavily influenced by other open source projects such as [Botman](https://github.com/botman/botman)
and [Zanzara](https://github.com/badfarm/zanzara), check them out too!

```php
<?php

use SergiX44\Nutgram\Nutgram;

$bot = new Nutgram($_ENV['TOKEN']);

$bot->onCommand('start', fn(Nutgram $bot) => $bot->sendMessage('Ciao!'));

$bot->onText('My name is {name}', fn(Nutgram $bot, $name) => $bot->sendMessage("Hi {$name}"));

$bot->run();
```
