# Getting updates

Currently, the framework mainly supports two different methods to process updates: `Polling` and `Webhook` mode.

- **Polling**: mainly useful for small bots or with not much traffic, but especially for development mode, since it allows
  you to start developing a bot in a short time!
- **Webhook**: Strongly recommended for bots with high traffic and more generally for production mode.
